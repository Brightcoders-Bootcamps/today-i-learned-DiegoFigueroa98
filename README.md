### Thu 22, July 2020 [Ruby On Rails Installation]
Rails is a Framework focused on creating websites according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It combines Ruby with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create web applications that run on a web server. It is considered server-side or Back-end.

In my case, I am using GNU/Linux, so first, you must have the Ruby language and the Rubygems library manager in the system, and after that, you can do the following:

Install Rails at the command prompt:
```console
diego@diego:~$ gem install rails 
```

Create a new Rails application:
```console
diego@diego:~$ rails new firstapp
```
